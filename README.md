## Summary 

On average, students at charter schools have higher math scores than students at public schools despite charter schools having a lower average budget than public schools. Some additional analyses that could be worth looking into include examining the average reading scores by school types and examining the average number of students by school type to see if there are any trends when it comes to school types vs reading scores and enrollment.
